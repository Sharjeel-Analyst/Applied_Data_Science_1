 Assignment Statistics and Trends

**Overview:**  
This report analyzes a dataset detailing information about gym members to uncover insights into exercise habits related to age, gender, experience level, body mass index (BMI), and calories burned. We will explore age trends among gym-goers, workout frequency by experience level, and the relationship between BMI and weight across genders. Additionally, we will examine calories burned based on experience level. These insights aim to inform gym management and enhance program development for improved member engagement and fitness outcomes.
We use Python and Jupyter Notebook, to explore statistical relationships and plotting within the data to derive actionable insights.

**Dataset:**

**Setup:**

Clone the Repository (https://github.com/Sharjeel-Analyst/Applied_Data_Science_1)

Install Requirements  pip install -r requirements.txt  

**Workflow:**

Data Cleaning and Loading: Involves preparing the dataset for analysis by addressing missing values, transforming data types, and filtering out irrelevant entries. 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct an initial exploration of the data to understand distributions and correlations among the various fields. 
Statistical Analysis: Analyze statistical trends to explore potential relationships and comparisons between variables. 
Visualization: Utilize data visualization techniques to convey insights, including histograms, bar plots, scatter plots, and box plots.

**Key Findings:**

These analyses of the various graphs reveal significant insights into the exercise routine of gym members. As histogram shows which age group works out frequently, the bar chart shows workout intensity by experience level, the scatter graph generates the weight and BMI relation or highlights the genders and the last Box graph shows which experience level group burns more calories in both males and females. By this data, fitness professionals can enhance the effectiveness of their interventions, ultimately promoting healthier lifestyle choices.

**Dependences:**

pandas, numpy and matplotlib.
